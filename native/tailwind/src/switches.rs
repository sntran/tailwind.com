//! The switches: each behavior of the compiler that changed in a release
//! of Tailwind CSS since `Version::OLDEST`.
//!
//! A switch has the first version with the new behavior and one sentence
//! about the change. The code of the new behavior is the port of the
//! newest version. At the place of the change, the code asks `NAME.on()`
//! and keeps the old behavior in the other branch:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! if switches::NAME.on() { /* as the newest version */ } else { /* as before */ }
//! ```
//!
//! How to find a switch that is not there: the fuzzer compares the Rust
//! compiler, with the version of an official package, with the compiler of
//! that package. Each difference is a behavior with no switch
//! (docs/VERSIONS.md, "The Rust compiler as an older version").
